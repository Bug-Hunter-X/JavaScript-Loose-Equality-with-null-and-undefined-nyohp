This example demonstrates a common error in JavaScript related to loose equality (==) when dealing with null and undefined values.  The function foo() intends to handle null input, but it does not explicitly check for undefined. This leads to NaN as the result when undefined is passed. The solution demonstrates the importance of using strict equality (===) for reliable comparisons and explicit handling of both null and undefined.
